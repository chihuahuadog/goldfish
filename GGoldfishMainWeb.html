               <p>
                  Remember coming home with a goldfish one day? How long did
                  you think it would live? A few days? Months? With proper
                  care your goldfish could of lived 20-30 years! The oldest
                  recorded goldfish lived up to 43 years old. So you may be
                  thinking: what is the secret? Well, it's no secret and had
                  you done some research first, you would have spared your
                  poor goldfish some suffering. Don't feel bad, most, if not
                  all, goldfish keepers have made the same mistake. In the
                  following sections, I will outline some information about
                  goldfish for you.

               </h3>
               <p>
                  You probably took your goldfish out the bag once you got
                  home, got some tap water from the sink, and stuffed the
                  goldfish into a tiny bowl or container that happens to be
                  nearby. Well, goldfish can grow up to be anywhere from
                  about 8 inches to 18 inches depending on the breed. You
                  simply just can't stuff a goldfish into a 8 inch diameter
                  bowl and hope it will live, it won't. If the goldfish
                  doesn't die from ammonia and nitrite buildup, it will die
                  from organs that keep expanding while its body is kept from
                  growing because of its small environment.<br />
                  There are main divisions of goldfish:
                  <strong>Fancy</strong> and <strong>Common</strong>(also
                  known as Comet or Feeder goldfish.
               </p>
               <ol>
                  <li>Fancy goldfish Fancy goldfish need about 20 gallons for
                     one goldfish and 10 gallons for each additional fish
                  </li>
                  <li>Common goldfish Common goldfish need about 30 gallons
                     for one goldfish and 12 gallons for each additional fish.
                  </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                  Secondly,<em>YOU CANNOT JUST PUT THE GOLDFISH IN TAP
                  WATER!</em> You must at least have the water sit for a few
                  days so that chlorine can evaporate or buy a water
                  dechlorinator. Furthermore, it is best that you cycle the
                  tank first.Set up the tank as you would if the goldfish was
                  in it. Then add in some nitrate and ammonia. Test the water
                  everyday until it shows zero ammonia, zero nitrite, and
                  some nitrite. This will make sure the beneficial bacteria
                  in the tank is effective and doing its job. Be sure to make
                  weekly water changes of about 10% to 50%.

               </h3>
               <p>
                  First of all, I will start with heaters. Heaters are
                  optional for goldfish since they are capable of surviving
                  in cold temperatures and will be perfectly fine as long as
                  the weather does not cause the water to freeze. Heaters are
                  beneficial in the way they keep the water temperatures from
                  fluctuating which causes stress to the goldfish. The main
                  types of filters avaliableavailable in most pet stores:
                  power filters, canister filters, internal filters,
                  undergravel filters, wet/dry filters and sponge filters.

                        These filters are best for tanks greater than 40
                        gallons.These have a siphon tube and flexible pipe work
                        going to the filter and then a pipe back up and into
                        the tank with a return �water bar� that spreads the
                        water outflow through a long bar. The chemical and
                        mechanical filtration is excellent due to the large
                        size of the filter and since they are pressurized which
                        forces the water through fine material that can trap
                        smaller particles.

                        severely limited due to its design and should be

                        are exposed to aquarium water and air which allows
                        bacteria to grow. Chemical filtration is acceptable,
                        but mechanical filtration is somewhat limited since the
                        water passes through large spored sponges. The system
                        is a lot of work to set up since it includes getting
                        water pumped directly to your aquarium with a sump or
                        reservoir to hold auxiliary water and water to run the
                        pump.

                        capable of producing biological and mechanical
                        filtration because beneficial bacteria live on the

               </h3>
               <p>
                  Goldfish do not need to be fed constantly! They are always
                  "hungry" and will literally eat until they die if you let
                  them. Feed them about once or twice a day with as much food
                  as they can consume in 5 minutes. Goldfish are omnivores
                  and need a variety of food.Goldfish pellets and flakes are
                  fine, but be careful and do your research! I advise not
                  buying goldfish food containing wheat or wheat gluten since
                  goldfish do not eat grain or chicken. Like us, goldfish
                  need veggies to balance out their diet. Just about any kind
                  of fibrous veggie will work. Examples include romaine
                  lettuce, spinach,fruits, and kale.Remember to clean out the
                  rotting vegetables afterward! Freeze-dried food is also
                  good.

                  Should I have a goldfish
               </h3>
               <p>
                  Goldfish are wonderful pets and although they probably
                  sound like a handful now, they are actually less
                  troublesome than some pets. You do not have to take them
                  on walks, they will not bark, they will not bite and so
                  forth. During vacations, you may safely leave them at
                  home for a few weeks without feeding them and most will
                  be fine upon your return. They are also very relaxing to
                  watch and graceful swimmers. However, goldfish do need
                  all the above mentioned and do get sick. Goldfish
                  maintenance, tanks, and certain types of goldfish are
                  expensive and will require some amount of money. It is up
                  to you about whether you are willing to put in the
                  effort. Of course it is perfectly legal to keep throwing
                  your goldfish into an unfiltered, unwholesome and tiny
                  bowl, but just imagine being locked up in your
                  bathroom/restroom all the time. Pretty miserable, right?

               <h3>Choosing a Goldfish</h3>
               <p>When choosing a goldfish there are certian things you should be aware of in order to find a healthy, active fish.</p>
               <h4>The following is a good list to keep in mind</h4>
               <ol>
                  <li>Is the fish active and looking for food? If a goldfish is not eating, there is something wrong!!!</li>
                  <li>Are all the fins present, un-frayed at the edges. Clamped fins are a bad sign!</li>
                  <li>Are there any red patches on the fins or body?  (Hard to see on red or orange colored fish)</li>
                  <li>Is there any white cotton wool like patches or pinhead size white spots anywhere on the fish?</li>
                  <li>Is the body full and rounded? (Consider the goldfish type you are purchasing.  A healthy Comet will be a lot slimmer than a sick Fantail, but the body should still be rounded and smooth, not appearing wasted).</li>
                  <li>Is the Goldfish breathing normally, not fast compared to other fish in the aquarium? NO RED GILLS!</li>
                  <li>Does the fish�s movement appear effortless or is it labored as if it is struggling to keep buoyant?</li>
                  <li>Few if any scales should be missing, and they shouldn't be extended like a pine cone (unless the goldfish is a Pearl Scale).</li>
                  <li>Is the fish twitching or scratching against the gravel or aquarium sides?</li>
               </ol>

                  These are some goldfish types. NOTE:Common Single tailed
                  and fancy goldfish should not be kept together. The
                  common goldfish swim more faster and are more aggressive.
                  They will bully the fancy goldfish and eat all the food.

                        fleshy growth on the top of its head called the wen.
                        The wen starts to show at about 3 - 4 months, but
                        only really begins to form at about 1 - 2 years. The

                        about 2-2 1/2 years old.
