             <p>
                Remember coming home with a goldfish one day? How long did
                you think it would live? A few days? Months? With proper
                care your goldfish could of lived 20-30 years! The oldest
                recorded goldfish lived up to 43 years old. So you may be
                thinking: what is the secret? Well, it's no secret and had
                you done some research first, you would have spared your
                poor goldfish some suffering. Don't feel bad, most, if not
                all, goldfish keepers have made the same mistake. In the
                following sections, I will outline some information about
                goldfish for you.

                Tank size and Maintenance
             </h3>
             <p>
                You probably took your goldfish out the bag once you got
                home, got some tap water from the sink, and stuffed the
                goldfish into a tiny bowl or container that happens to be
                nearby. Well, goldfish can grow up to be anywhere from
                about 8 inches to 18 inches depending on the breed. You
                simply just can't stuff a goldfish into a 8 inch diameter
                bowl and hope it will live, it won't. If the goldfish
                doesn't die from ammonia and nitrite buildup, it will die
                from organs that keep expanding while its body is kept from
                growing because of its small environment.<br />
                There are main divisions of goldfish:
                <strong>Fancy</strong> and <strong>Common</strong>(also
                known as Comet or Feeder goldfish.
             </p>
             <ol>
                <li>Fancy goldfish Fancy goldfish need about 20 gallons for
                   one goldfish and 10 gallons for each additional fish
                </li>
                <li>Common goldfish Common goldfish need about 30 gallons
                   for one goldfish and 12 gallons for each additional fish.
                </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
                Secondly,<em>YOU CANNOT JUST PUT THE GOLDFISH IN TAP
                WATER!</em> You must at least have the water sit for a few
                days so that chlorine can evaporate or buy a water
                dechlorinator. Furthermore, it is best that you cycle the
                tank first.Set up the tank as you would if the goldfish was
                in it. Then add in some nitrate and ammonia. Test the water
                everyday until it shows zero ammonia, zero nitrite, and
                some nitrite. This will make sure the beneficial bacteria
                in the tank is effective and doing its job. Be sure to make
                weekly water changes of about 10% to 50%.

             </h3>
             <p>
                First of all, I will start with heaters. Heaters are
                optional for goldfish since they are capable of surviving
                in cold temperatures and will be perfectly fine as long as
                the weather does not cause the water to freeze. Heaters are
                beneficial in the way they keep the water temperatures from
                fluctuating which causes stress to the goldfish. The main
                types of filters avaliableavailable in most pet stores:
                power filters, canister filters, internal filters,
                undergravel filters, wet/dry filters and sponge filters.

                      the tank with a return water bar that spreads the
                      water outflow through a long bar. The chemical and
                      mechanical filtration is excellent due to the large
                      size of the filter and since they are pressurized which
                      forces the water through fine material that can trap
                      smaller particles.

                      are exposed to aquarium water and air which allows
                      bacteria to grow. Chemical filtration is acceptable,
                      but mechanical filtration is somewhat limited since the
                      water passes through large spored sponges. The system
                      is a lot of work to set up since it includes getting
                      water pumped directly to your aquarium with a sump or
                      reservoir to hold auxiliary water and water to run the
                      pump.

                      filter is powered by an air pump where water is forced
                      to pull through the sponge-like material. The sponge is
                      capable of producing biological and mechanical
                      filtration because beneficial bacteria live on the

                Feeding
             </h3>
             <p>
                Goldfish do not need to be fed constantly! They are always
                "hungry" and will literally eat until they die if you let
                them. Feed them about once or twice a day with as much food
                as they can consume in 5 minutes. Goldfish are omnivores
                and need a variety of food.Goldfish pellets and flakes are
                fine, but be careful and do your research! I advise not
                buying goldfish food containing wheat or wheat gluten since
                goldfish do not eat grain or chicken. Like us, goldfish
                need veggies to balance out their diet. Just about any kind
                of fibrous veggie will work. Examples include romaine
                lettuce, spinach,fruits, and kale.Remember to clean out the
                rotting vegetables afterward! Freeze-dried food is also
                good.

                Should I have a goldfish
             </h3>
             <p>
                Goldfish are wonderful pets and although they probably
                sound like a handful now, they are actually less
                troublesome than some pets. You do not have to take them
                on walks, they will not bark, they will not bite and so
                forth. During vacations, you may safely leave them at
                home for a few weeks without feeding them and most will
                be fine upon your return. They are also very relaxing to
                watch and graceful swimmers. However, goldfish do need
                all the above mentioned and do get sick. Goldfish
                maintenance, tanks, and certain types of goldfish are
                expensive and will require some amount of money. It is up
                to you about whether you are willing to put in the
                effort. Of course it is perfectly legal to keep throwing
                your goldfish into an unfiltered, unwholesome and tiny
                bowl, but just imagine being locked up in your
                bathroom/restroom all the time. Pretty miserable, right?

             <h3>Choosing a Goldfish</h3>
             <p>When choosing a goldfish there are certian things you should be aware of in order to find a healthy, active fish.</p>
             <h4>The following is a good list to keep in mind</h4>
             <ol>
                <li>Is the fish active and looking for food? If a goldfish is not eating, there is something wrong!!!</li>
                <li>Are all the fins present, un-frayed at the edges. Clamped fins are a bad sign!</li>
                <li>Are there any red patches on the fins or body?  (Hard to see on red or orange colored fish)</li>
                <li>Is there any white cotton wool like patches or pinhead size white spots anywhere on the fish?</li>
                <li>Is the body full and rounded? (Consider the goldfish type you are purchasing.  A healthy Comet will be a lot slimmer than a sick Fantail, but the body should still be rounded and smooth, not appearing wasted).</li>
                <li>Is the Goldfish breathing normally, not fast compared to other fish in the aquarium? NO RED GILLS!</li>
                <li>Does the fish movement appear effortless or is it labored as if it is struggling to keep buoyant?</li>
                <li>Few if any scales should be missing, and they shouldn't be extended like a pine cone (unless the goldfish is a Pearl Scale).</li>
                <li>Is the fish twitching or scratching against the gravel or aquarium sides?</li>
             </ol>

                These are some goldfish types. NOTE:Common Single tailed
                and fancy goldfish should not be kept together. The
                common goldfish swim more faster and are more aggressive.
                They will bully the fancy goldfish and eat all the food.

                      The Oranda Goldfish is one of the most popular

                      fleshy growth on the top of its head called the wen.
                      The wen starts to show at about 3 - 4 months, but
                      only really begins to form at about 1 - 2 years. The
                      hood is fully developed when the fish gets to be
                      about 2-2 1/2 years old.

                      to the Ryukin's head.

                      The eyes are the most curious characteristic of the
                      Telescope Goldfish. Their large eyes are set on top
                      of long telescope or cone-like stalks mounted on the
                      sides of its head. On some individuals, these stalks
                      can extend out as far as 3/4 of an inch (19 - 20 cm),
                      but they don't really start to protrude until these
                      fish are about 6 months old.

                      Veiltail Goldfish have a round body and extremely
                      long, delicate-looking fins. Their double caudal
                      (tail) fin and anal fins are well separated. Like the
                      Fantail, their dorsal fin is held erect, but the
                      Veiltail Goldfish's dorsal fin is quite long and can
                      grow to over 2 1/4 inches (6 cm).

                      The Common Goldfish is a small member of the
                      Cyprinidae family of carp fish. These are one of the
                      hardiest of the goldfish varieties. They are known as
                      a choice beginner fish for new aquarists because they
                      are one of the easiest fish to keep.

                      The Shubunkin Goldfish are beautiful fish that are
                      almost always speckled or have a variegated color
                      pattern. However, what makes the Shubunkin's
                      appearance unique is not their wild calico
                      patterning, but their blue color. Blue is a color
                      that is quite rare in goldfish.
